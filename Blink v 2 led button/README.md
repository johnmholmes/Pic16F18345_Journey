# Pic16F18345_blink v2

Version 1 is my first attempt and was tested and works fine.

Version 2 is just been modified to create a pic setup function as learnt from my involvement with Dan for the stepper motor project.

Version 3 is just a change to the code so only has 3 leds, but I have changed my coding style to use more function calls in the main loop.
