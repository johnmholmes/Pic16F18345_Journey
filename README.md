# Pic16F18345_Journey

I am a hobbyist programmer and have not been college or university trained in programming.

This is the start of my learning to use the Pic16F18345 20 pin chip using C it is only my way of doing this and may not be the correct way or the best way.
 
This is used for me to look back on if i need a reminder of how I did things in the future.

# I have previously covered the Pic16F676

To do the basic control of the GPIO pins but this chip is know to have issues when being programmed with the Pickit 3 and 4.

This Chip I have the 20 pin version Dip mounted on a bread board a 14 pin version is also available.

I am programming the Pic using the MPLAB X IDE version 6.00 and using the XC8 compiler as this is the software I know about.
