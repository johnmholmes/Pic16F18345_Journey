# Setting Up The Pic

This is my journey into programming the Pic16F18345 for various projects, such as railway modeling and aquarium-related endeavors. As a hobbyist programmer with no formal training, I conduct thorough research and testing before adding anything to my GitHub page. This serves as a tool for me to track the progress of any code I work on. Please note that this is for fun and educational purposes only, and may not necessarily represent the best approach to these tasks.
